# Automatic Bot Hosting

This is a Discord Bot that can set up other Discord Bots automatically.

Either with a zip file that contains the Python source code or with an ssh git clone address. (git clone will automatically update)

The Bot was not made with other people in mind, so if you use this for yourself as well, you will need to modify it for it to work in your environment.
